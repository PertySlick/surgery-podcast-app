        Behind The Knife is the leading surgical podcasts that interviews leaders in surgery
        from a broad range of specialties, to provide our listeners with a "behind the scenes"
        look at the interesting, controversial and humanistic side of surgery from some of the
        giants in the field. We also strive to provide top notch surgical education material
        from ABSITE to Oral Boards to assist our listeners in becoming surgeons.
